This project uses typescript and yarn

# Installation
Make sure to use yarn to install dependencies

each day might require a different solution file, so please check the relevant
typescript files to ensure that the proper data file and filename is being provided.

# Running the different solution scripts
You can run whichever day's solution typescript file that you want

# As an example, this will run day 6 solution
yarn s 06
